# Drupal 8 Quick Start package on Nginx & PHP-FPM
This is a *Drupal 8* quick start package for Redhat OpenShift PaaS. Depending on
the system requirements [mentioned here](https://www.drupal.org/requirements),
this package needs PHP 5.5+ setup.

Currently RedhatOpenShift doesn't provide that so this quick start is dependent
on two other packages
* [Openshift Nginx Cartridge](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-nginx)
* [Openshift PHP Plugin Cartridge](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php)
